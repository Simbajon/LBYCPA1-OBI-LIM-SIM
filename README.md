# Project Description:
    The Movie Organizer is a program that helps users organize their movie collection by sorting them based on their release date and genre. 
    The program prompts the user to input the name of the movie, its release date, and its genre. It then creates a list of movies sorted by year and genre and saves it to a file. 
    If the user inputs a movie with the same release year and genre, the program adds it to the existing list. Otherwise, it creates a new list for the new year and genre.
